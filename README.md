## Breathing APP

This simple app was created first of all for a personal use based on [Wim Hof method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/). You can use original app or follow the instruction on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) . This app is not affiliated with Wim Hof.

I decided to create this app as a simple exercise to learn React and create a tool where i could have more control over the settings and track my performance. I decided to open it to the public in case you find it useful.
